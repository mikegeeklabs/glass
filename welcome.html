<H1>GLASS = GeekLabs Application Starter Scripts</H1>
<h4>GLASS Version 0.1 2014-12-21, Winter Solstice Edition</h4>
The basic applation framework and key pieces all work well enough to use in
other projects that I need to start work on. 
<hr>
<h2>GLASS Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>A reasonably secure framework for basic PHP/MySQL/MariaDB applications.
<li>Support for the PHP Native MySQLI connectors
<li>Useful for both web and CLI usage
<li>Multi-language/timezone support
<li>Table Data Editing and Reporting
<li>Clear Easy To Read/Maintain Code
<li>Minimal CSS and no jQuery required.  
<li>Using HTML5 for Datepickers and other elements
</ol>
<h2>Release Log</h2>
<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>What</th></tr>
<tr><td>2014-12-21</td><td>0.1 release, basics work.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>To Do:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Remove/replace Bootstrap CSS from report module
<li>BBF/Internationalize Everything
<li>Find a way to "de-auth" when using Chrome and MSIE. Firefox handles basic auth properly
<li>Build my own charting system for reporting (currently using FLOT)
</ol>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create database (MySQL/MariaDB) and load 'database.sql'
<li>Edit settings.inc (note; configure webserver to not deliver .inc files)
<li>Make sure HTTPS is configured for this site. "basic auth" is only secure when using HTTPS, which you should be using anyway. StartSSL.com is worth exploring. 
<li>Use 'glass.php' - default login is:  admin /1234  (yes, you need to change that password, edit the users table. 'passwd' field is bcrypt hashed)
</ol>
