<h2>Release Log</h2>

</table>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Made Cutestrap (www.cutestrap.com) the default CSS
<li>Lots of little changes, updates, etc.. 
</ol>
<h2>To Do:</h2>
<ol>
<li>BBF/Internationalize Everything
<li>Find a way to "de-auth" when using Chrome and MSIE. Firefox handles basic auth properly
<li>Build my own charting system for reporting (currently using FLOT)
</ol>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create database (MySQL/MariaDB) and load 'database.sql'
<li>Edit settings.inc (note; configure webserver to not deliver .inc files)
<li>Make sure HTTPS is configured for this site. "basic auth" is only secure when using HTTPS, which you should be using anyway. StartSSL.com is worth exploring. 
<li>Use 'glass.php' - default login is:  admin /1234  (yes, you need to change that password, edit the users table. 'passwd' field is bcrypt hashed)
</ol>
